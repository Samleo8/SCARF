    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <h6>Stereo Cross Attention Radiance Field</h6>

    <p>
        In Stereo Cross Attention Radiance Fields, we explore adding transformer-based techniques to Stereo Radiance Fields<cite>1</cite>. In recent years, there have been great advances in transformer techniques which allow for faster training and consistent architecture across models. The original SRF paper uses a complex stereo pair association technique which we fully replace with a transformer. Finally, the radiance field is decoded into an image.
